            <p>Hello! My name is Ron - last name still pending for approval by album manager. I'm a aspiring computer science and analysis engineer who is hoping to enjoy the wonders of programming computing technologies (until I have to work on C++)</p>
            <p>I have minor experiencing modding video games and proceding to getting frustrated at said modding due to developers not intending for other people to access these APIs and work with their cryptid spaghetti code like real human beings that have lives outside of a dictionary. Including but not limited to Paper Mario, Minecraft, Terraria, and GMOD.</p>
            <p>Despite that traffic of information, my favourite games that I binge on occassion have to be:</p>
            </br>
            <ul>
              <li><img src="isaacicon.png" width="64px"> - Binding of Isaac: Rougelike dungeoncrawler where you kill poop with your tears. Don't worry it gets better after the section where you unravel the dogma rule of conviction and then kill God with tears and poop. There's a lot of time to kill in this game when there are 34 characters, each with 11 unique objectives you need to get on the hardest difficulty and more, it'll take around 1000 hours before you can actually play the game.</li>
              <li><img src="payday2icon.png" width="64px"> - Payday 2: Replayable horde shooter where you roleplay heisters and do wacky cop-and-robbers-esqe situations like robbing a jewelry store, doing illegal art trades with a shady billionare, stealing nukes and transporting them to a crazed arms dealer, stealing nukes and transporting them to a crazed arms dealer a second time, and robbing a bank atleast 3 other times.</li>
              <li><img src="tf2icon.png" width="64px"> - Team Fortress 2: Favourite game of all time, been with it since 2012. Class-based shooter with a 1950's artstyle topped with amazing voice-acted characters, great comedy, weapons, gameplay, maps, and more. Hard to ignore it ever in my life.</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>But how did this tragic series of events and things come to pass?</p>
            <h2>Flashback...</h2>
            <p>It all started in whenever when the whoevers did whatever wherever, and now I'm here forever. I had a nice childhood, I played games, I went outside, played with friends, got extensively bullied, played some Super Mario games like Galaxy & Sluggers, and owned the largest DS game collection in the block. You could say I was a 'certified badass'.</p>
            <figure><img src="daoldpalce.png" width="775px"><figcaption>This is da place where I used to live.</figcaption></figure>
            <p>I grew up in Virginia Beach, and with the new quality of water parks, aquariums, coastlines, and blue skies, I eventually developed a nice favouritism for the color: Blue. I don't show it, but I really like the color blue when it suits the moment. Oh well, years and years of blue moments went by peacefully with my cul-de-sac friends and community, playing games, doing events, being outside and living life to it's fullest...</p>
            <p>Then we got redcarded, our lawyer lost the paperwork twice, and we were forced to move from Canada. Do I miss my old home? No. Do I miss the memories of not having school work? Yeah. I then moved to Markham as a temporary home after crossing the border, but it was boring, bland, and still in development. My only playground there was a landmass, and while it was a fun little demilitarized warzone while it lasted, it then became the most boring desolate park space imaginable.</p>
            <figure><img src="boringpark.png" width="775px"><figcaption>This is all that is it, just grass and walkways.</figcaption></figure>
            <p>From there it's a boring few years of my life. My cousins visited, I first discovered Pizza, and binged Phineas and Ferb every single day after school. Additionally discovering my love for Team Fortress 2 and oddly enough, a typing practice game. Yep, that's the basis of my childhood right now, I can compare it to that rollercoaster that has loops which exponentially get smaller and smaller to stop your bloodflow.</p>
            <h2>Sooo... what's now here, numbnuts.</h2>
            <p>Well the lack of anger-management skills aside, I do have some neat things I can do. I'm alright in C, Java, C#, and Python. While I'm not the most successful game-modder, I'm proud at the miniature things I've made, namely some mods that I've published. During the break between semesters, I'm planning on studying Selenium for job related purposes. Additionally, I'm studying Unity in hopes of doing a small hobby alongside getting a job as a software developer.</p>
            <p>Hopefully I've given you enough background exposition narrative who-ha to grant you a small tease about myself so you can ponder and obsess over me for the rest of your revolving-around-me life - because that's the end. Yeah I've exhausted myself with my ambitions, skills, lifestory, and desires, but I think this is a nice website that's all about me and my really big ego. That being said, I hope this was a girthy and content-packed website in your eyes.</p>
            <p>Bye!</p>
